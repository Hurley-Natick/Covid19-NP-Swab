# Covid19-NP-Swab
As clinical laboratories around the world have begun testing for Covid-19, we have encountered a new crisis: a shortage of the swabs required to obtain the necessary sample. These are called nasopharyngeal swabs, or NP swabs for short.

The goal of this repository is sharing expertise to manufacture NP swabs.

More specifically, because the crisis is now, the goal is to re-create versions of the swabs already in use (as opposed to creating better/fundamentally different redesigns).

The files in this repo contain some information to get started.

If anyone has any questions, please reach out to any of the contributors here or to Dr. Ramy Arnaout, MD, DPhil, at rarnaout@bidmc.harvard.edu or rarnaout@gmail.com.

This is a team effort with already at least 25 people involved from all over the country, including industry, academia, and just members of the public, none looking for thanks or recognition, helping out just because they can.

Anything you find or post here is free for use for all.
