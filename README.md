# Covid19-NP-Swab
Designing or repurposing a nasopharyngeal swab for COVID19 testing

As clinical laboratories around the world have begun testing for Covid-19, we have encountered a new crisis: a shortage of the swabs required to obtain the necessary sample. These are called nasopharyngeal swabs, or NP swabs for short.

The goal of this repository is sharing exertise to manufacture swabs.

More specifically, because the crisis is now, the goal is to re-create versions of the swabs already in use (as opposed to better/fundamentally different designs).

Start by reading this document, which contains a more complete description of the swabs along with the key design criteria:
[Initial_Spec.doc](/nasopharyngeal_swab_initial_spec_031720.docx?raw=true)

The other files in this repo contain more information to get started and some initial designs.

If anyone has any questions, please reach out to any of the contributors here or to Dr. Ramy Arnaout, MD, DPhil, at rarnaout@bidmc.harvard.edu or rarnaout@gmail.com.

We emphasize that this is a team effort with already at least 25 people involved, none looking for thanks or recognition.

Anything we find or post here is free for use for all.
