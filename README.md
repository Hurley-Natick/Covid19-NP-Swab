# Making NP swabs

As clinical laboratories around the world have begun testing for Covid-19, we have encountered a new crisis: a shortage of the swabs required to obtain the necessary sample. These are called nasopharyngeal swabs, or NP swabs for short.

**The goal of this repository is sharing information required to manufacture NP swabs locally/everywhere at volumes of thousands per day, until standard manufacturers can make and deliver more.**

Because the crisis is **now,** the goal is to re-create versions of the swabs already in use (as opposed to creating better/fundamentally different redesigns).

The files in this repo contain some information to get started.

If anyone has any questions, please reach out to any of the contributors here or to Dr. Ramy Arnaout, MD, DPhil, at rarnaout@bidmc.harvard.edu.

This is a team effort with already dozens of people involved from all over the country, including industry, academia, and just members of the public, none looking for thanks or recognition, helping out just because they can.

Anything you find here is free for use for all.

## Basic description of an NP swab

An NP swab is a flexible stick around 15cm in length that goes up your nose to the back of the nasal cavity (see [movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXohAo1d6tk&feature=youtu.be&t=40)). It is swept or twirled around to brush or wick up secretions, which carry Covid-19 virus particles. The swab comes out of the nose and goes into a vial that contains fluid (viral transport medium). The vial gets capped and sent for processing.

There are two parts: a bristled bulb end (above) and a shaft. Often the shaft itself has a thin neck, for flexibility, and a thicker handle. The handle is often *scored*---a weak point in the shaft---where you can break it off so the bristled part stays in the vial; the handle is then thrown away.

The distance along the handle where the scoring occurs depends on the vial you use. For example, for the vials for use with Copan 480C swabs, the breakpoint is 7cm; for [15-](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/falcon-15ml-conical-centrifuge-tubes-5/p-193301) or [50-mL](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/falcon-50ml-conical-centrifuge-tubes-2/p-193321) conical tubes (of the kind used routinely in biomedical research and sold by many manufacturers), 11.5 cm will do (the 15mL Falcons are listed as 12cm, 50mL as 11.5cm, but we haven't checked yet whether this is interior height or includes the cap).


<a name="reqs"></a>
## Requirements

-	Wand is stiff enough to push to the back of the nasal cavity but flexible enough to get up the nose and will bend when it hits resistance instead of stabbing people (for reference, swabs are a little more flexible than the tiny straws used for coffee, and somewhat similar to the inside tube that holds the ink when you take apart a Bic ballpoint pen)

-	Ideally, the bulb end is *flocked* (see below): it has lots of tiny bristles perpendicular to the wand (see close-up above). The bristles provide for a high surface-area-to-volume and helps both wick secretions onto the bristle and liberate particles when put in the transport medium. Perpendicularity is a nice-to-have that we believe may improve yield slightly but requires electrostatic deposition; even random orientation of flock should work fine

-	Bristles or collecting substrate (including any adhesive) must be firmly attached and not get left behind in the nasal cavity. Similarly no part of the swab should break off or get left in the nasal cavity. We have enough problems with the pandemic already

-	Materials cannot inhibit [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction). This means no wood or cotton (although we believe rayon is OK; see partial list of PCR inhibitors below). Nylon and polypropylene seem to be good choices, but start with medical equipment/grade materials if possible since they should be high quality/pure (some additives can be inihibitors).

-	Wand must break off inside the tube – better to be too short than too long.  Wand could be manually scored to create a weak point


<a name="not-reqs"></a>
## NOT required

-	Sterility. Not a major concern for most uses; only for immunocompromised (in which case the ability to decontaminate by [autoclaving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclave) or ethanol bath is needed). The air and the nose are already non-sterile and the PCR assay is specific enough to ignore most contaminants (as long as other Covid-19 contaminated things/people don’t come in contact with it and it doesn’t pick up PCR inhibitors)

-	Labor intensive is ok, to fill short term needs. There are students and researchers out of school and lab who are willing to volunteer to hand-assemble these from inoculation loops, adhesive, and wicking substrate #studentArmy
