# Mechanical Testing Procedures
1) static load breaking test
   - fix distal end of swab
   - apply static load to bristle-end
   - measure breaking with load
   - ensure breaking occurs at at snap-point, not on bristle shaft or bristle head

2) dynamic load breaking test
   - fix distal end of swab
   - apply static load to bristle-end
   - measure breaking with load
   - ensure breaking occurs at at snap-point, not on bristle shaft or bristle head
   
3) static load bending test 
   - fix distal end of swab
   - apply static load to bristle-end
   - measure bending angel with load
   - ensure swab bends and flexes less than maximum angle
   TODO: *specify maximum angle-per-load constraints* (e.g. 75 degrees and XX Newtons)

4) dynamic load bending test
   TODO: *define this*

# Chemical Testing Procedures
1) test that swab absorbs viral RNA particles
2) test that swab does not interfere with PCA/reagents


# Absorption Testing Procedures
1) quantify amount of absorption
   TODO: *quantify absorption of current swabs and test against current/old standard*
   - fill vials with fluid (what viscosity / chemical composition to simulate nasopharyx fluid?)
   - measure volume of absorption over certain time period (TODO: *assume 5 seconds?*)
   
# Sample Collection Testing Procedures
1) with Methylene blue stain solution
   - do cheek swab (try to air out mouth and pick a less saliva-coated part of the cheek) or NP swab
   - smear onto a glass slide
   *if the smear doesn't result in any visible material left on the slide, place 50ul of buffer solution (saline, PBS, EPA water, etc) on the slide and roll the swab around in the buffer, dragging the liquid around the slide surface.

   - add 2 drops (~80ul) of methylene blue solution to the slide
   - cover with a cover slip and image
   - epithelial cells and bacteria should be visible under 4-10x magnification
