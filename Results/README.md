# Results summary, BIDMC

This document summarizes BIDMC's evaluation of dozens of [**geometries**](#geometries) (swab designs) and [**materials**](#materials) ([full data here](REF)), with brief comments on [**decontamination/sterilization** and **packaging**](#decon), [**production volume**](#volume), and [**clinical trials**](#trials).

## Geometries

**Note:** examples shown are not necessarily the preferred material and not necessarily from the manufacturer who created the design. No attribution of credit is made or implied by this listing.

### Tip

#### Preferred tips (no order):

Honeydipper

Hexagon 

<img src="bristle_tip.png" width=40%>

Bristle

Note none of these are [flocked]("https://github.com/HMS-RIC/Covid19-NP-Swab/#flock"). FDA says flock is **preferred** but **not required**.

### Shaft

#### Preferred shaft:

1mm-diameter neck, 2.5mm-dimater handle and \~2mm breakpoint located 7cm from tip-end of swab.

### STL files

We do not have all stl files for all designs tested; what we have are [here](../design_files/). If you need one we don't have, please contact its [creator](np_swab_results.xlsx)). If you have an stl file to share, please email it to ccallah@bidmc.harvard.edu with *STL-FILE_\<identifier>_\<company>* in the subject field.

## Materials

### Handling

Key features (best performers in parentheses): 

- straight (HP > Carbon3D, FormLabs)
- smooth to the touch (Carbon3D > FormLabs, HP)
- dry (not sticky) (Carbon3D, HP, FormLabs > OPT)
- stiffness comparable to that of the inkholder of a bic pen...
- ...yet flexible: capable of being bent 180 degrees without breaking (except at the breakopint) (HP, Carbon3D)
- breaks at breakpoint (should be somewhat difficult to do) (HP, FormLabs)

Keysplint Soft (Carbon3D)


### PCR compatibility

All materials tested so far are PCR compatibile.


<a name="decon"></a>
## Decontamination/sterilization and packaging

Autoclaving preferable, isopropanol or 70% ethanol washes with clean packaging acceptable.

Likely process: swabs produced and washed at scale, then:

- (option 1) take to a company with autoclavable paper packaging (e.g. Georgia-Pacific, 3M), or

- (option 2) packaged at manufacturer's site (e.g. EnvisionTec)

EnvisionTec's packaging



<a name="volume"></a>
## Production volume

**To my knowledge** EnvisionTec, HP, FormLabs, and Carbon3D all have capacity for producing at least hundreds of thousands per day.


<a name="trials"></a>
## Field testing, safety, market

**Field testing.** Field testing means using swabs on nasopharynx of people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2.

At BIDMC we have tested for appropriateness by (infectious disease/clinical pathologist) expert evaluation, and tested for sufficiency of collection using cheek swab and Gram stain as a surrogate for viral particle collection from nasopharynx. We have **not** field tested.

Field testing requires IRB approval.

To my knowledge Dr. Summer Decker at USF has field-tested at least on non COVID-19-suspected cases. She has an IRB.

I suggest as a first step other clinical sites model after USF's IRB and have their local IRBs cede review to USF as URB of record.

**Safety.** Note swabs are FDA Class-1 exempt devices; "garage testing" not advised.

**Market.** Several tip/shaft/material combinations will likely yield usable products. There will be a competitive market. A/B testing, marketing, contracting, etc. are beyond the scope of this document.
