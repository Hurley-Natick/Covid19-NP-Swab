These swabs were printed using HP MJF 3D printing technology using PA12 material at Fathom Studios in Oakland Ca.

# Flexibility
- swabs are quite flexible
- can bend more than 180 degrees without breaking

# Torsional Load (twisting)
- ISSUE: shaft snapped off at head or along body of bristle with 540 degrees of twisting (tested on 3 - 540, 720, 900 degrees)
- TODO: define spec for torsional load, add tests in simulation, strengthen bristle to shaft interface to ensure breakage at snap-point

# Static Load at Tip (bending to break)
- ISSUE: bends first and eventually breaks at bristle to swab shaft interface
- ISSUE: break-off-point requires multiple back-and-forths bendings to break off
- TODO: make break-off-point weaker (test V's, grooves, stress points - in simulation)
