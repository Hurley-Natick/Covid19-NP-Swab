Inspired by Jenny's DIYSwab design this should be printable on any FDM that
can print a suitable material (perhaps nylon or PP). The process uses the
[3D printing on fabric](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-3D-Print-Onto-Fabric/)
technique to embed mesh inside a 3D printed swab.

The construction process involves:

1. printing a base layer for all swabs
1. while the printer is paused, placing the mesh onto the print surface (taped to the bed to keep it in place)
1. finishing the print, traping the mesh between the layers
1. letting the parts cool before removing them from the build plate
1. cutting away the excess mesh

For the v1 prototype, 5 swabs were printed in 6 minutes (not including heat-up/cool-down).
Dimensions were guessed (100 mm long shank, 50 mm break-off, ~4x2 mm inside loop).

Although the included [code](v1/gen_swab_gcode.py) generates gcode directly
the design could likely be made compatible with a standard slicer to improve
print quality by using retracts etc.
