1) nasopharyngeal swab nubs V1:  https://a360.co/2Qyh2GE
   - <img src="abiogenix_swab_nubs/bristle_nubs_V1.png" width=40%>
   - bristle with 6x15 0.7mm dia raised nubs,
   - bristle surface area 129 mm^2
   - need to fix shaft so max-stress point is at snap-off point, not on bristle shaft
    
2) nasopharyngeal swab round V1:  https://a360.co/2wpGHui
   - <img src="abiogenix_swab_round/swab_round_shaft.png" width=40%>
   - featureless bristle: 1.25mm diameter shaft
   - bristle surface area: 61 mm^2
   - LESS SURFACE AREA BUT CAN BE USED TO ATTACH EXTERNAL BRISTLE OR COATING
   
3) nasopharyngeal swab nubs holes V1: https://a360.co/2U5CzbK
   - <img src="abiogenix_swab_nubs_and_holes/bristle_nubs_holes.png" width=40%>
   - bristle with 6x15 0.7mm dia raised nubs, and 0.35mm dia holes
   - bristle surface area: 167 mm^2
   - PREFER NOT TO USE MODELS WITH HOLES INSIDE TO REDUCE POST-PROCESSING
