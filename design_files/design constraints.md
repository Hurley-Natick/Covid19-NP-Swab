# Mechanical Constraints

Swab Shaft
-   	outer diameter of swab is 3mm or less
-     wand should flex (75 degrees? - check this)
-     wand should break 7cm from tip
-     bristles should be 1.5mm in length
-     bristles should maximize surface area

Bristle Coating
-     coating of bristles involves flocking (post processing step), 
-     but if there is a way to mechanically generate this, even better
