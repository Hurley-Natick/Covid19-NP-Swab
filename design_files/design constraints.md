# Mechanical Constraints

Swab Shaft
-   	outer diameter of swab is 3mm or less
-     minimum swab length is 15cm - *confirm this*
-     wand should flex (75 degrees? - *confirm this*
-     wand should break 7cm from tip
-     bristles should be 1.5mm in length
-     bristles should maximize surface area

# 3D Printing Constraints
-     minimum feature size/resolution of MJF 3D printing is 0.7mm
-     material is PA11 or PA12 nylon - confirmed FDA biocompatible (

Bristle Coating
-     coating of bristles involves flocking (post processing step), 
-     but if there is a way to mechanically generate this, even better
